# Python Polynomial Module
 
## David John Wilson

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Davidjohnwilson/PythonPolys.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/Davidjohnwilson/PythonPolys)

This module is intended to implement basic polynomials in python. They will be entirely symbolic computations wherever possible.

Note, this module will be fairly basic and is intended mainly as a learning exercise. If you wish to do true symbolic computation in Python you should check out [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) (and think of contributing to the project!).

I am currently working on building this out into a full library. The latest stable version will be in the `development` branch and the aim will be for full documentation and test coverage (the travis-ci status of this branch will be shown in the badge above). The original code (which was in a sort of pseudo-package) will be kept in the `master` branch for now.
