# Python Polynomial Module
 
## David John Wilson

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Davidjohnwilson/PythonPolys.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Davidjohnwilson/PythonPolys)

This module is intended to implement basic polynomials in python. They will be entirely symbolic computations wherever possible.

Note, this module will be fairly basic and is intended mainly as a learning exercise. If you wish to do true symbolic computation in Python you should check out [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) (and think of contributing to the project!).
