Git stuff:
Open in powershell
	See current status
		git status
	Add a file
		git add FILENAME
		<Then commit and push>
	Log local changes
		<add files in the commit>
		git commit -m "Message you want to put"
		OR
		git commit -a -m "Message you want to put" (the -a adds the files before committing)
	Push stuff up to Github
		git push -u origin master
	Remove a file from the entire repository
		git rm FILENAME
		<Then commit and push>
	'Unstage' files you have committed (basically undo an add)
		git reset FILENAME
	Pull any new changes from github
		git pull origin master
	Get git history
		git log
	Get differences with latest version
		git diff HEAD
	See changes you have committed but not pushed
		git diff --staged
	Revert a file to the last commit
		git checkout -- FILENAME
	Create a new branch (to be alongside master)
		git branch BRANCHNAME
	Switch to a different branch
		git checkout BRANCHNAME
	Merge a branch into master
		git checkout master     // switching to master branch
		git merge BRANCHNAME
	Get rid of a branch
		git branch -d BRANCHNAME

	Shortcut version of pushing? 
		git push
