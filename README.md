# Python Polynomial Module
 
## David John Wilson

This module is intended to implement basic polynomials in python. They will be entirely symbolic computations wherever possible.

Note, this module will be fairly basic and is intended mainly as a learning exercise. If you wish to do true symbolic computation in Python you should check out [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) (and think of contributing to the project!).
